       <p>  My name is India, and no, I wasnâ€™t named after the country. I attended Fall Mountain Regional High School, which is where I developed an interest in the Graphic Communication industry. I was lucky enough to take several classes in high school like web design, desktop publishing, digital photography, and computer illustration. These classes were my favorite part of high school, and taking them got me interested in pursuing a degree in graphic arts.<br><br>
I considered several colleges when the time came, but I eventually landed on Cal Poly (the admissions people at RIT told me Cal Poly was the best). Traveling light, I arrived at school with two suitcases. My first class was GRC 101 with Ken Macro. Immediately I knew I would love my major.
Currently I am a third-year Graphic Communication student with a concentration in Graphics for Packaging. I am also pursuing a minor in packaging through Orfalea College of Business. My goal is to graduate in June, 2017 and return to the east coast to work in the packaging industry.
