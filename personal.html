       <p>  My favorite hobby is to spend time with my beautiful dogs when I’m in New Hampshire. I have two golden retrievers; Flynn and Gilligan. They are the happiest creatures I’ve ever known.I also have a beautiful nephew, Bob Barker, the pit bull.<br><br>
During the summer I spend my time with my family in Prince Edward Island, Canada. I have spent almost every summer there since I was a baby. At this point we have explored just about every town on the small island, but we spend most of our time on the North Shore in a small town called Malpeque. Malpeque is the home of Malpeque Bay, which is where about 90% of the world famous PEI mussels come from. The island is renowned for many other types of seafood including lobster, oysters, clams, and crab. If you like seafood the island is a must-see (and the mussels are much cheaper if you buy them directly from the fishermen). <br><br>
My family also enjoys to camp at various spots around the island. Our favorite spots are Cabot Provincial Park and Red Point. When we aren’t camping we are staying at the family cottage, which is on the beach of Malpeque Bay.
